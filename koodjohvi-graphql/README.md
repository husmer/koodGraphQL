### GraphQL

This application is a user dashboard built with React and Apollo Client, utilizing GraphQL for data fetching. Users can log in with their credentials, which are authenticated via a JWT token. Once authenticated, the dashboard displays user-specific data, including ID, login, account creation date, user level, and audit ratio. The dashboard also visualizes user experience points (XP) over time and per exercise as graphs.
